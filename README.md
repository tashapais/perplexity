sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis
```

3. **Configure API keys** (optional for demo):
```bash
# Edit backend/.env and add your keys:
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key_here        # Get from https://api.search.brave.com/
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here            # Get from https://exa.ai/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here      # Get from https://platform.openai.com/
```

### Start Development

```bash
# Start all services at once
./dev.sh

# Or start manually:
# Terminal 1: redis-server (if not using brew services)
# Terminal 2: cd backend && python main.py  
# Terminal 3: npm run dev
```

**üåê Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

### Demo Mode
Forest Search works without API keys in demo mode! It will show:
