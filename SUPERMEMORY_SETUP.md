# Supermemory Integration Setup

ResearchHub now includes supermemory connectors to sync documents from Google Drive, Notion, and OneDrive!

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Demo Mode)

The integration works out of the box in demo mode:

1. **Visit Connectors Page**: http://localhost:3000/connectors
2. **Click "Connect"** on any provider (Google Drive, Notion, OneDrive)
3. **See Demo Connection** - A mock connection will be created
4. **Test Sync Features** - All functionality works with simulated data

## ðŸ”‘ Enable Real Connections

To connect to actual Google Drive, Notion, and OneDrive accounts:

### 1. Get Supermemory API Key

- Visit [supermemory.ai](https://supermemory.ai)
- Sign up for an account
- Get your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Configure Environment

Edit `backend/.env`:

```env
# Add your actual supermemory API key
SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY=your_actual_supermemory_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Backend

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. **Available in Search** - Shows up in research results
3. **Cited in Answers** - AI can reference your documents
4. **Organized by Source** - Filter by provider (Google Drive, Notion, etc.)

## ðŸ”„ Sync Process

Based on [supermemory documentation](https://supermemory.ai/docs/memory-api/connectors/overview):
